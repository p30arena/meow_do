# Product Context: MeowDo

## Why this project exists

MeowDo aims to provide a comprehensive solution for individuals to effectively manage their goals, tasks, and time, particularly catering to mobile users. It addresses the common challenge of staying organized and productive by offering a structured approach to defining objectives and tracking progress.

## Problems it solves

*   **Disorganization:** Helps users organize their goals and daily tasks within defined workspaces.
*   **Time Management:** Enables users to budget time for tasks and provides warnings for over-allocation, promoting realistic planning.
*   **Task Tracking:** Offers clear status indicators for tasks, allowing users to monitor their progress (pending, started, failed, done). It also provides granular time tracking for tasks, enabling users to record actual time spent and view summaries.
*   **Prioritization:** Allows users to assign priority levels to tasks, helping them focus on what's most important.
*   **Personalized Experience:** Enables users to set their preferred timezone for accurate time-related data.
*   **Goal Achievement:** Provides a framework for setting and tracking goals, with status updates (pending, reached) to encourage completion.
*   **Mobile Accessibility:** Designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure usability and accessibility on smartphones, where many users manage their daily lives.

## How it should work

Users will be able to:
1.  Create and manage multiple workspaces.
2.  Define goals within each workspace, including names, descriptions, and optional deadlines.
3.  Break down goals into daily tasks, each with a time budget.
4.  Monitor the total time allocated for tasks daily and receive warnings if it exceeds 24 hours.
5.  Easily copy tasks to subsequent days for recurring activities.
6.  Update the status of tasks and goals as they progress.
7.  **Start and stop tasks** to accurately track time spent, and view aggregated time summaries (daily, monthly, yearly) in a bar chart.
8.  Assign a **priority** level to each task (1-10).
9.  Set and store their **timezone preference** for accurate time displays.
10. Experience a seamless and intuitive interface on mobile devices.

## User experience goals

*   **Intuitive and User-Friendly:** The interface should be easy to navigate and understand, even for first-time users.
*   **Efficient Workflow:** Users should be able to quickly add, modify, and track goals and tasks with minimal friction.
*   **Visually Appealing:** The design should be clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing, utilizing ShadcnUI, TailwindCSS, and Lucide Icons.
*   **Responsive:** The application must adapt flawlessly to various screen sizes, prioritizing the mobile user experience.
*   **Accessible:** Support for multiple languages (English, Arabic, Farsi), both light/dark modes, and Right-to-Left (RTL) and Left-to-Right (LTR) layouts to cater to diverse user preferences.
*   **Motivating:** The tracking and status features should encourage users to stay on track and achieve their goals.

## Brief overview
This rule set outlines preferences for handling internationalization (i18n) translations within the project.

## Translation Guidelines
- When updating or adding translation keys in the main language file (e.g., `en/translation.json`), ensure these changes are also applied to all other language files (e.g., `ar/translation.json`, `fa/translation.json`).
- Approximations for translations in non-main language files are acceptable; perfect accuracy is not required for initial implementation.
